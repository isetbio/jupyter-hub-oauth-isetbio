# jupyter-hub-oauth-isetbio
Docker support for isetbio "front porch", with JupyterHub and OAuth

The idea is that all of the generic, reusable config lives in the `ninjaben/jupyter-jub-oauth-isetbio` Dockerfile.

Then all of the site-specific config, like SSL, users, and local Matlab install, goes in a separate [`deploy-helper`](https://github.com/benjamin-heasly/jupyter-hub-oauth-isetbio/blob/master/deploy-helper) script and gets mounted into the Docker container at run time.

# Deployment
To do your own deployment, you'd copy the `deploy-helper`, edit it with your own site-specific config, and run it.  Or just use the `deploy-helper` as documentation for how to work with `ninjaben/jupyter-jub-oauth-isetbio`.  You do you!

Here are the site-specific configs you need:
 - Google account email addresses for known users.  At least one admin (you!).
 - A domain name where you'll host your JupyterHub.  You can use `lvh.me` to point back at localhost, which is great for testing.
 - OAuth web app Client Id and Client Secret obtained from your [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
 - Your own SSL certificate and key.  Or, the `deploy-helper` can self-sign one for you.
 - The path to the Matlab installation on the Docker host.
 - The path on the Docker host where to put the Matlab execution logs.
 - The MAC address associated with your own Matlab license.
